    text1:`The Bechdel test is a test for a work to see if it portrays women in a positive light. For a work to pass the test, 
        it must contain 1) at least two female characters 2) who talk to each other 3) about something other than a man. These 
        three criteria can help see if a movie or other literary work is making an effort to portray women positively. As Parker 
        puts it, “such questions offer a basic gauge of respect, agency, and dignity.” (Parker 154).`,
    text2:`Alyssa Rosenberg states in her article about the test that “the Bechdel Test doesn’t even get close to reorienting the 
        entertainment industry or to subject matter and emotional tones that have been traditionally considered female rather than 
        excitingly masculine.” She brings up the seemingly encouraging fact that “every movie released between 2014 and 2017 that 
        made a billion dollars or more at movie theaters around the world passed the Bechdel Test.” (Rosenberg), but then goes on 
        to talk about these movies in more detail, and how they aren’t that different from movies starring men. She states “it 
        suggests that movies with reasonably prominent female characters can make a bundle of money as long as they aren't very 
        different from movies that star mostly men”. One example of this is the movie “Zootopia”, which stars a female bunny who 
        wants to become a police officer. Rosenberg states that the movie is essentially a cuter remake of “Chinatown”, which stars 
        a male.`,
    text3:`The Bechdel test is a very low bar, and it’s clear that passing it is causing Hollywood to have great success. Hollywood 
        doesn’t actually have to try to dismantle the patriarchy they face to convince people they are female-friendly, they just 
        have to give a few females a few lines of dialog within a film to make money. Despite this, the Bechdel test can provide 
        insight into if a film or other literary work meets a baseline criteria of treating women respectfully. The test can also 
        be expanded upon, since the three requirements of it aren’t bad by any means.`,
    text4:`Below is a survey of popular movies from 2001 (the year “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” was released). 
        You will be asked to guess if the movie passes the Bechdel test (yes for passes and no for not passing). All movie
