        correctAnswer: "Yes",
        explanation: `This rating seems to be a bit contraversial. 
            There is evidence that two female characters talk to each other, however, 
            their conversation is somewhat about men, since one of the female (Hermione) is telling 
            the other female (Professor McGonagall) that Harry and Ron (both male) saved her from the troll.`
