    text1:`At a base level, feminism is about “taking women seriously and respectfully” (Parker 149). It seeks to recognize 
        misogyny and correct stereotypes of women. `,
    text2:`There are three waves of feminism that Parker defines in his book on critical theories. First-wave feminism was all 
        about establishing basic rights for women, such as the right to own property. This wave began in the late 1700s and gave 
        way to second-wave feminism in the 1960s. Like the first wave, this wave focused on gaining equal rights for both genders, 
        but also sought to celebrate the differences of women from men. It often pushed the idea that all women should share a similar 
        identity. In the late 1970s to early 1980s, third-wave feminism developed out of a sense that not all women are the same. 
        This wave “focused on the variety of women” (Parker 150) and attempts to include all women of different colors and backgrounds. 
        Some claim that we are in an extended age of third-wave feminism, while others say we have reached “postfeminism”. This label 
        means different things to different people, to some that we have moved beyond a need for feminism, and to others that we are 
        ready to “reimagine feminism for changing times” (Parker 150).`,
    text3:`While early feminism could sometimes seem to show women as victims of their circumstances, more recent feminism attempts 
        to focus on women’s agency. A woman’s agency is her “ability to imagine and shape [her] own [life].” (Parker 157). While 
        feminism still pays attention to what is done to women (their objectivity), it also pays attention to what they do (their 
        subjectivity). This helps shift the focus away from them being victims to focus on their accomplishments instead, which 
        in turn shows their value in society.`,
    text4:`Strong female characters in literary works are female characters who exhibit great strength in one or more areas. For 
        example, Hermione Granger in the *Harry Potter* series is one of these characters, showing great knowledge and skill with magic. 
        Often times, these characters seem to reject all aspects of traditional femininity and are extremely powerful with few 
        weaknesses. As Parker states “Such characters might seem to reinforce a feminist desire for women to break past traditional 
        barriers and control their own lives.” (153). In this sense, these characters are great role-models, but upon further 
        investigation, they may not be as positive as it seems. For one, this can set unrealistically high standards for young 
        girls to reach. They may walk away from these types of works thinking that they are only valuable in society if they can be 
        as perfect as the female lead they saw on the screen or in the book. Another flaw of these characters, is that they can be 
        seen to “mock the supposed weakness of real women outside the movies.” (Parker 153). Some may view the strong female character 
        as empowering, while others may not. While this type of character is neither all good or all bad, it is good to keep these 
        points in mind while looking at them.`
