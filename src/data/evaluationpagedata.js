    text1:`One of the earliest feminist literary criticisms was the “images of women criticism”. This criticism focuses on if the work 
        provides a positive image of women. In this way, if the work shows a “good” woman, then it is a good work and vice-versa. The 
        problem with this type of criticism is that implies that “women characters must be good “role models,”” (Parker 152). Another 
        issue with this criticism, is its focus only on the characters. As Parker states, “a feminist interpretation depends not so 
        much on the characters themselves as on the broader social contexts that shape how we process the characters.” (Parker 154). 
        This means there is more to keep in mind than just how the female characters are portrayed when looking at a work. Showing a 
        “bad” female character can also highlight the strength and potential of women without making it a belief that that is how 
        women are. With this in mind, a “bad” female character can actually still give off a respectful view of women. So, while 
        this criticism doesn’t work well as a sole indicator of whether a work positively portrays females, it does function well to 
        call out stereotypes and unrealistic portrayals of women.`,
    text2:`During the early forms of criticism, women’s writing was celebrated, as many people didn’t recognize that women had 
        something to offer the literary community. Now however, this is unnecessary, as it is demeaning to women to suggest that 
        their writing is doubted and we “need to compensate for our doubt by celebrating women’s writing.” (Parker 157).`,
    text3:`One thing to keep in mind while using feminism is that “feminism best serves its purpose of respecting women when it 
        takes into account the differences among women and advocates for less privileged as well as for more privileged women,” 
        (Parker 165). This simply means that we need to take things like race, class, and education into account when viewing women. 
        There is no one way to interpret every woman, since every woman comes from a different background. Keeping in mind things like 
        class and race can help us understand and respect women better.`,
    text4:`As discussed above, the images-of-women criticism isn’t all bad. It can be useful to keep people from saying “anything 
        goes” in terms of feminist writing. It can keep things from becoming dangerous, and it makes sure that we listen to our 
        inner voice when it tells us that something is wrong about the portrayal of a woman. Of course, it is always good to go 
        deeper to see if our initial reaction can be expanded upon, but it is always good to keep the images-of-women criticism 
        in mind to keep from thinking that everything is okay and respectful.`,
    text5:`As Parker states, “feminist criticism is not about labeling books as good or bad, sexist or nonsexist.” (Parker 169). 
        To interpret a work using this critical theory, all you need to do is to respect women and take them seriously. There are 
        often many ways to interpret a work, and no one interpretation can get in all the possibilities. Parker states, however, 
        that any interpretation getting beyond the basics will be interesting and potentially worthwhile. Since there is no one 
        clear-cut way to look at a work using the feminist critical theory, I will be looking at a particular work below, “Harry 
        Potter and The Sorcerer’s Stone”, to hopefully give users a better idea of what it looks like to use this critical theory.`,
