    text1:`One of the earliest feminist literary criticisms was the “images of women criticism”. This criticism focuses on if the work 
        provides a positive image of women. In this way, if the work shows a “good” woman, then it is a good work and vice-versa. The 
        problem with this type of criticism is that implies that “women characters must be good “role models,”” (Parker 152). Another 
        issue with this criticism, is its focus only on the characters. As Parker states, “a feminist interpretation depends not so 
        much on the characters themselves as on the broader social contexts that shape how we process the characters.” (Parker 154). 
        This means there is more to keep in mind than just how the female characters are portrayed when looking at a work. Showing a 
        “bad” female character can also highlight the strength and potential of women without making it a belief that that is how 
        women are. With this in mind, a “bad” female character can actually still give off a respectful view of women. So, while 
        this criticism doesn’t work well as a sole indicator of whether a work positively portrays females, it does function well to 
        call out stereotypes and unrealistic portrayals of women.`,
    text2:`During the early forms of criticism, women’s writing was celebrated, as many people didn’t recognize that women had 
        something to offer the literary community. Now however, this is unnecessary, as it is demeaning to women to suggest that 
        their writing is doubted and we “need to compensate for our doubt by celebrating women’s writing.” (Parker 157).`,
    text3:`One thing to keep in mind while using feminism is that “feminism best serves its purpose of respecting women when it 
        takes into account the differences among women and advocates for less privileged as well as for more privileged women,” 
        (Parker 165). This simply means that we need to take things like race, class, and education into account when viewing women. 
        There is no one way to interpret every woman, since every woman comes from a different background. Keeping in mind things like 
        class and race can help us understand and respect women better.`,
    text4:`As discussed above, the images-of-women criticism isn’t all bad. It can be useful to keep people from saying “anything 
        goes” in terms of feminist writing. It can keep things from becoming dangerous, and it makes sure that we listen to our 
        inner voice when it tells us that something is wrong about the portrayal of a woman. Of course, it is always good to go 
        deeper to see if our initial reaction can be expanded upon, but it is always good to keep the images-of-women criticism 
        in mind to keep from thinking that everything is okay and respectful.`,
    text5:`As Parker states, “feminist criticism is not about labeling books as good or bad, sexist or nonsexist.” (Parker 169). 
        To interpret a work using this critical theory, all you need to do is to respect women and take them seriously. There are 
        often many ways to interpret a work, and no one interpretation can get in all the possibilities. Parker states, however, 
        that any interpretation getting beyond the basics will be interesting and potentially worthwhile. Since there is no one 
        clear-cut way to look at a work using the feminist critical theory, I will be looking at a particular work below, *Harry 
        Potter and The Sorcerer’s Stone*, to hopefully give users a better idea of what it looks like to use this critical theory.`,
    text6:`*Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone* is the first book in a very popular series by J. K. Rowling. The books feature a 
        young wizard named Harry Potter as he grows up and attends Hogwarts, a school of witchcraft and wizardry, and eventually 
        defeats an evil wizard who is trying to take over. Harry is almost constantly accompanied by his friends, Ron Weasley and 
        Hermione Granger, who help him save the world from the evil wizard Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are the three main 
        characters of the series, though there are a variety of other characters used as friends or enemies throughout the book, 
        such as Neville Longbottom or Bellatrix Lestrange. Since I will be focusing only on the first book of the series, I will be 
        looking mainly at Hermione Granger, since there are not many other named female characters in the first book.`,
    text7:`At a glance, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone* seems to be free of gender stereotypes. Both males and females 
        can attend the wizarding school of Hogwarts, and they receive equal schooling as well as equal access to the school’s 
        main sport, quidditch. Besides that, one of the main characters, Hermione Granger, is female and is portrayed as extremely 
        smart and confident. Her house is Gryffindor, which implies that she is brave, and she ends up being extremely important to 
        Harry as the series progresses. A first impression could be that Hermione is a positive role model and the perfect example 
        of a girl breaking free from stereotypes. However, a closer reading would suggest that maybe this book isn’t quite as 
        female-friendly as meets the eye.`,
    text8:`The first thing to be noted is the lack of female characters in the first book. While several other females show up in 
        later books, most of them are unimportant and only used for a short time, such as Harry’s girlfriend Cho Chang. 
        There are a greater number of important male characters, which could suggest a lack of importance placed on females. 
        This lack of gender representation could be discouraging to young girls who want to see other females being treated as 
        important. Hermione and Professor Minerva McGonagall are the only two important females in the first book, and I will be 
        focusing mainly on Hermione for the purposes of this interpretation. `,
    text9:`Though Hermione is smart, she gets constantly made fun of for it. At one point, Hermione is sharing tips about flying a 
        broomstick, but it is clear that no one wanted to listen to her (“she bored them all stupid with flying tips she’d gotten out 
        of a library book… everybody else was very pleased when Hermione’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.” 
        (Rowling 144)). A while later, it’s stated that “Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a 
        bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus.” (Rowling 164). At another point, Hermione corrects Ron’s 
        pronunciation of a spell and herself performs it correctly. After this, Ron says, “It’s no wonder no on can stand her… 
        she’s a nightmare, honestly.” (Rowling 172) and a few lines later says, “She must’ve noticed she’s got not friends.” 
        (Rowling 172). Andrea Powers addresses this scene in her dissertation over gender and race constructions in several 
        Harry Potter books. She states, “This implies that they do not consider themselves to be friends with her, even though 
        she had saved them with her knowledge of magic” (Powers). This shows how unwilling Harry and Ron were to be friends with 
        Hermione initially due to her “know-it-all” personality. Powers also observes that Ron seems to be angry that Hermione 
        appears smarter than he is, so he makes a comment that “her behavior is distasteful to everyone at the school” (Powers). 
        This indirectly sends a message to young girls that they can’t be confident in their knowledge at risk of appearing unfeminine 
        (Powers). Hermione overhears Ron’s comment, and “reverts back into the female stereotype by running to the restroom and crying 
        over her hurt feelings” (Powers). While some may see showing Hermione’s emotion as adding depth to her character, it is also 
        possible to view this as showing that women can’t handle their emotions. A short while later, Hermione sees a troll in the 
        bathroom and screams, shrinking against the wall in fear. This is uncharacteristic of her and shows that “her emotions 
        interfere with her intelligence” (Powers). Harry and Ron end up having to save her from the troll, which goes back to the 
        stereotype of males saving the females. `,
    text10:`Hermione is also given a sort of motherly role throughout the books. Melanie Cordova touches on this in her article about 
        gender in Harry Potter. She states about Hermione that, “Her proficiency as knowledge-bearer is either displayed in a motherly 
        way, is undermined by language that renders her hysterical, or by behavior that renders her servile.” (Cordova). Hermione uses 
        her knowledge to take care of Harry and Ron. She can often be seen chastising the boys for their rash decisions or helping 
        them with various things (“It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn’t know how he’d have gotten 
        through all his homework without her” (Rowling 181). Cordova also observes that, “The intersection of Hermione's 
        knowledge-bearer position and that of a motherly figure can be quite a positive representation of a young woman, but 
        the fact that it is Harry who applies the motherly layer to Hermione makes the representation less Hermione's choice 
        and more Harry's vision for the women around him.” (Cordova). This shows the ways in which Hermione is not allowed to 
        function as her own character with the ability to live how she wishes, but she must conform to the roles that the men 
        in her life put her into.`,
    text11:`Overall, while Hermione Granger may seem like a great picture of females being respected in the literary world, there are 
        still several flaws to her representation that may perpetuate certain stereotypes. Taking a deep dive into literary works to 
        find these hidden stereotypes can help people recognize them in their own lives and help them view women in a more serious and 
        respectful light.`
