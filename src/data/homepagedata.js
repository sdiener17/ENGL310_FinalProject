    text1:`This website was created with the purpose of informing people more about the feminist critical theory and how to 
        apply it to literary texts, along with challenging any stereotypes they may have. I hope to show how people can use 
        this theory on their own to come to a decision on whether a text or film treats women seriously. Hopefully those who 
        use this site will come away better able to recognize misogyny in a work, and not just assume it treats women well because 
        of certain aspects, such as containing a strong female character.`,
    text2: `Visit the [Information](/information) page to learn more about feminism. The [Evaluation](/evaluation) page provides a description of how to use 
        this critical theory when looking at a work, along with an example of using this critical theory on the text *Harry Potter 
        and the Sorcererâ€™s Stone*. Finally, the [Survey](/survey) page provides information about using the Bechdel test to see if a film 
        respectfully represents females and provides a quiz to see if you can guess if certain movies pass the test. `
